Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering uses engineering principles, tools and methods to develops and maintain high quality software systems.
Software engineering aids in creation of software applications and systems that power different aspects of modern life, including 
communication, commerce, entertainment, healthcare. Its also help in terms of Automation and Robotics, Reliable software and handling of ambigious projects.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of Programming Language:
Establisment of Software Engineering 
advent of structured programming in the 1970s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: This involves gathering and documentation of users need and software requirements.
Designs: This is the phase that involves the creation of details design of the software architecture and software interface.
Implementation: This stage deals with code writing and devloping the software according to the design requirements.
Testings: Periming numerous tests to ensure the software meets standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: This is the phase where the software is release to the consumer.
Maintenance: Going forward, to provide adequate support, and updates, to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
 Waterfall: This involves a sequential set of approach with distinct phases (requirements, or implementation) flowing of water vertically in a stream.
 Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on delivering a finished product through collaborative efforts.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: They are responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: TAkes priority in the ensuring that softare quality is met by designing and executing tests plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Enviroments: This is one of the tools that is used to streamline the development processes by providing comprehensive tools for writing codes, testing and debugging. (e.g Visual Studio)
Version Control Systems: this involves tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g Git)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements
Meeting tight Deadlines
Technical Debt.

Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Chalenges can be overcome by effective communication, agile methodologies or prioritization of tasks by filtering of urgent tasks.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components.
System Testing: Testing of the entire sofware
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining the queries given to AI models to generate a desired outputs. Prompt engineering helps in getting relevant, accurate, and useful feedbacks, making interactions with AI more productive and effective.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Tell me about school, This is quite broad and could lead to various interpretations, school system, Curriculum, levels etc.
A more improve prompt is Tell me about Mechanical Engineering Tertiary Institution, this is more refine and clear prompt, have narrowed my preferences to get the best possible reposense form the AI
